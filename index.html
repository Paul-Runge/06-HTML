                <p>My name is Paul.  I grew up in Baton Rouge, LA.  I left high school in my junior year and obtained my GED instead.  That very summer I entered college, but did not enjoy it very much.  Seeing as how I had started in the
                     culinary field while still in highschool, I persued a career as a chef.  I worked at various establishments around SE Louisiana and briefly in tiny town in western North Carolina before return to Baton Rouge.  North Carolina was 
                     beautiful, and I really hated to leave.

                <p>For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to travel.  In the summer of 2016 I quit my job and toured around the US for several months.  At times it was nerve wracking, but ultimately very rewarding.  
                    I saw some amazing sights, camped in scenic forests, and met some unique and intersting people.  After spending a week reconecting with some old friends living in Portland, I decided to move there.  I spent nearly 2 years 
                    saving money, then left town with whatever I could fit in my car heading to the PNW.  That was nearly five years ago.  I really enjoy living here.  With easy access to great food, the ocean, and all the hiking one could dream of, 
                    I can't imagine living anywhere else.</p>
